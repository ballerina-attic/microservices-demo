## Challenges

The challenges are based on the “[Hipster Shop: Cloud-Native Microservices Demo Application](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo)” 
developed by Google Cloud. It is a web-based e-commerce application with 10 microservices written in different programming languages that 
talk to each other over gRPC. You can refer to the original [README.md](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/blob/master/README.md) file 
to learn more about this application. Here is a brief overview of the service architecture.

[![Architecture of microservices](./docs/img/architecture-diagram.png)](./docs/img/architecture-diagram.png)

All you have to do is implement the following microservices in Ballerina. The order of services indicate how much Ballerina 
knowledge you will need to implement it (the first service requires very little knowledge of Ballerina, etc.) as well as the 
lines of code. We recommend you to complete the challenges in the order they appear in the below table to make the 
learning process easy.

| Microservice  | Original Language | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [adservice](https://github.com/ballerina-guides/microservices-demo/blob/master/src/adservice)  | Java | Provides text ads based on given context words |
| [currencyservice](https://github.com/ballerina-guides/microservices-demo/blob/master/src/currencyservice)  | NodeJS  | Converts a certain amount in one currency to another currency. |
| [checkoutservice](https://github.com/ballerina-guides/microservices-demo/blob/master/src/checkoutservice)  | Go  | Retrieves the user cart, prepares the order and orchestrates the payment, shipping and the email notification. |


### Here’s What You Need to Do

Take a look at the steps for each service below to understand how you need to implement the logic. Check out the original 
source code for more information.

| Microservice  | Instructions |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [adservice](https://github.com/ballerina-guides/microservices-demo/blob/master/src/adservice)  | <ol><li>Implement a service to generate ads based on given context keys.</li></ol>  |

**Note**: Execute `eval $(minikube docker-env)` after installing Minikube so 
that the Docker client points to Minikube’s docker registry.

### GitHub Repository

1. Create a private GitHub repository in your account. Do not fork this repository if you want to keep your code 
private during the hackathon. An example repository name would be `ballerina-hackathon-kubecon-na-19`.

2. Run the following commands to merge the microservices-demo content to your newly created repository.
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/<gitbubusername>/ballerina-hackathon-kubecon-na-19

    $ cd ballerina-hackathon-kubecon-na-19

    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ballerina-guides/microservices-demo.git

    $ git pull upstream master

    $ git push origin master
    ```

### Running Hipster Shop Application (unchanged)
1. Clone this repository, and go to the repository directory.
2. Run `kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml` to deploy the app.
3. Run `kubectl get pods` to see whether pods are in a Ready state. 
4. If all the pods are running, `kubectl get service/frontend-external`
5. Find the IP address of your application, then visit the application on your browser to confirm installation. 
(http://localhost:80)
    ```sh
    kubectl get service/frontend-external
    ```
    Note: If you are on Minikube, get the hostname by executing `minikube ip`. e.g., <MINIKUBE_IP>:<FRONTEND_EXTERNAL_PORT>

    Congrats, you have successfully installed the default application by now.
    
6. Run `kubectl delete -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml` to delete what's deployed.

### Running the Hipster Shop Application with Ballerina Services
To help you get started, we’ve already implemented the recommendation service in Ballerina, and the source code is available in the `src/recommendatationservice_ballerina` directory.

1. Go to the repository directory and run the start script:
   ```sh
   sh scripts/start.sh
   ```

2. Check pods with `kubectl get pods`

3. Access the web UI (http://localhost:80 or `http://<MINIKUBE_IP>:<FRONTEND_EXTERNAL_PORT>`)

4. Run the `scripts/stop.sh` script to delete what's deployed.

Now that you’ve successfully installed and deployed the Hipster Shop application with one microservice written in Ballerina, it’s time to start working on the challenges. 

The microservices in this application talk to each other over gRPC. I.e, the microservices that you are implementing will receive requests over gRPC and they will also integrate with other microservices over gRPC. You can find the protocol buffers description [here](./pb/demo.proto).

The first step would be to generate Ballerina gRPC service skeletons and client stubs. You can follow the following guides to learn more about gRPC support in Ballerina. 

- https://ballerina.io/learn/how-to-generate-code-for-protocol-buffers/ 
- https://github.com/ballerina-guides/grpc-service
- https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/grpc-unary-blocking.html

### Generating Ballerina source code for gRPC protocol buffers
Go to  your repository directory and run the following command to generate Services from proto file.
```sh
ballerina grpc --input pb/demo.proto  --output stubs --mode service
```
Now the “stubs” directory will have the generated Ballerina services and client artifacts as below.

Services skeletons
- AdService_sample_service.bal
- CheckoutService_sample_service.bal                
- PaymentService_sample_service.bal
- RecommendationService_sample_service.bal    
- ProductCatalogService_sample_service.bal     
- CurrencyService_sample_service.bal
- CartService_sample_service.bal   
- EmailService_sample_service.bal   
- ShippingService_sample_service.bal

Client stubs
- demo_pb.bal

Note: You can copy the relevant service skeleton file and the demo_pb.bal file to your project.
 
Let’s start by writing the [recommendationservice](./src/recommendationservice) in Ballerina. We’ve already implemented this service for your reference. Here are the steps that we followed. You can repeat the same for all 3 challenges.  

### Let's start with the Recommendation Service
In Ballerina, the code is structured using projects and modules. A module is a directory which provides collaboration, sharing, and reuse of Ballerina code. Projects can have multiple related modules.
Please find more information [here](https://ballerina.io/learn/how-to-structure-ballerina-code/).

In this demo, our recommendation is to create a Ballerina project for each microservice. Let’s append “_ballerina” to the name of the microservices that you are working on. 
 
1. Go to the src directory and run the following command to create a new project.
    ```bash
    $ cd src
    $ ballerina new recommendationservice_ballerina
    ```
    
2. Change the directory to the project directory you just created.
    ```bash
    $ cd recommendationservice_ballerina
    ```

3. Add a new Ballerina module. This is where we maintain the code that belongs to the recommendationservice. 
    ```bash
    $ ballerina add recommendationservice
    ```
    
    **Note**: You can delete the unnecessary generated files such as the main.bal file and the tests and resources 
    directories inside the module directory.
    
4. Copy the corresponding service template source file and the demo_pb.bal file to the module directory.
    ```bash
    $ cp ../../stubs/demo_pb.bal src/recommendationservice/
    $ cp ../../stubs/RecommendationService_sample_service.bal src/recommendationservice/
    ```

    Note: The demo_pb.bal file needs to copied to each project which contains clients and common constructs. 
    
5. Now that you have some Ballerina code try compiling the code with the `ballerina build -a` command. This command 
builds all the modules in your project. If the build is successful, you can find an executable JAR file in the 
project's `target/bin` directory.

6. Refer the original instructions of each service defined in the [Challenges section](#Challenges), and rewrite the 
logic in ballerina. Refer to the original source code to get an understanding of the business logic. 

7. Checkout the diagram view for the service you implement.

    You can follow the plugin specific instructions to view the diagram.
    - [VSCode](https://ballerina.io/learn/tools-ides/vscode-plugin/graphical-editor)
    - [IDEA](https://ballerina.io/learn/tools-ides/intellij-plugin/using-intellij-plugin-features#viewing-the-sequence-diagram)
    
    For example, the current implementation for the recommendation service would generate the following diagram. 
    [![Diagram for the recommendation service](./docs/img/RecommendationService.png)](./docs/img/RecommendationService.png)


8. Introduce `@kubernetes:Service` and `@kubernetes:Deployment` annotations to integrate generating the k8s artifacts during the build (Refer the recommendation service for examples). Make sure to use correct service name.

    You can refer the following resources for detailed explanations on using the annotations:
    - [Kubernetes Deployment Ballerina by Example](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/kubernetes-deployment.html)
    - [The Kubernetes-Based Deployment section of How to Run and Deploy Ballerina Programs](https://ballerina.io/learn/how-to-deploy-and-run-ballerina-programs/)
    
    For example:
    ```ballerina
    @kubernetes:Service {
        serviceType: "ClusterIP",
        name: "recommendationservice"
    }
    ```

    **Note**: A k8s deployment will be created by default, but if you need to change it, you can introduce the `@kubernetes:Deployment` annotation with the relevant configuration.
    
    Additionally, if you are using Minikube you would have to introduce the following deployment config.
    ```ballerina
    @kubernetes:Deployment {
        dockerHost: "tcp://<docker_ip>:<docker_port>", 
        dockerCertPath: ".minikube/certs"
    }
    ```

    You can still skip the above when using Minikube by executing `eval $(minikube docker-env)`.
     
9. Build and generate the k8s artifacts to ensure there are no errors.
    
    ```bash
    $ ballerina build recommendationservice_ballerina
    ```

10. Once you’ve completed a service, update the start.sh file to use the Ballerina implementation of that service. You can replace the current command for the particular service with the Ballerina commands for them instead.

    For example:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f  $DEMO_HOME/kubernetes-manifests/recommendationservice.yaml
    
    # ballerina build --sourceroot $DEMO_HOME/src/recommendationservice_ballerina/src/recommendationservice --all
    # kubectl apply -f  $DEMO_HOME/src/recommendationservice_ballerina/target/kubernetes/recommendationservice
    ```

    Here, comment out the first line and uncomment the second and third lines to use the Ballerina build and generated artifacts for the  service.

11. Repeat step 10 for the stop.sh file.

12. Run the modified setup script and check the status of the pods.
    ```bash
    $ kubectl get pods
    ```

13. Tail the logs of your services.
    ```bash
    $ kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
    ```

14. Access the web UI (http://localhost:80 or http://<MINIKUBE_IP>:<FRONTEND_EXTERNAL_PORT>)

15. Use the stop script to clean the deployments.

16. Then move on to the next challenge and repeat steps 1 - 15.
